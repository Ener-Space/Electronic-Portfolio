          	<p class="text-end">Hello, My name is Marcus Sosa! Currently, I'm a upcoming senior in Waipahu High School. In Waipahu High School, I'm a student under the IET/AOIT pathway. When describing myself, I personally like to think I'm an affable person, but thats my opinion on myself, and others can think differently. I'm someone who can learn concepts fairly quick, such as when I was learning HTML and by extension Bootstrap. Although I live in Hawaii right now, I actually moved here from the Philippines when I was young. Right now, my career objective is to become either a Data Scientist or a Software Engineer.</p>

          	<h3 class="pl-5 text-start goals" id="about">My goals</h3>
          	<p class="pl-5 text-start"id="goal-yap">I have many goals I can talk about right now. For example, My current goal for high school is to finish my early college program so I can graduate high school with an associates degree. <br> My goals for after High School is to go to college and complete my 4-year, which should be easier due to me getting my 2 year when I graduate.<br> My final goal is to hopefully be able to enter the computer science field as a data scientist or as a software engineer.<br> I set these goals for myself because if I didn't, I wouldn't really know what to do in life, so I needed a way to keep me on my path.</p>
